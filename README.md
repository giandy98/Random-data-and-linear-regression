Random data and linear regression


This project consists of creating simulated data and manipulating it on a spreadsheet structured in six tabs:

1. Parameters: Contains basic parameters for generating data (probability, mean, standard deviation).
2. Data: Randomly generated age column of 250 individuals and random number groups.
3. Sample: Filtering of a sub-sample based on groups.
4. Statistical insight: Calculation of statistics such as standard deviation, mean, and confidence interval.
5. (Un)correlated variables: Correlation analysis between age, number of cats and age of partner.
6. Linear regression: Linear regression between age and rank, with scatterplot and analysis of results.

Each tab requires specific formatting and calculations to analyse and visualise the data.
